* Find JPLUS emission line objects
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       
:END:

** Motivation
I want to know the population of H\alpha emitter in JPLUS DR2 and described what kind of objects they are.

** Query for database

The follow query allows to download objects form JPLUS with very good photometry in 6\arcsec aperture.

Probing this configuration: min_samples=60, min_cluster_size=30
Estimated number of clusters: 2
Estimated number of cluster points: 238802
Estimated number of noise points: 20615

+ Seems that with  min_samples=20, min_cluster_size=80 parameters got good results.
